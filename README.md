# 🧭 Medlink Learning Path

Welcome to the **16-week Medlink Learning Path**!  
This roadmap is designed as a structured bootcamp to build modern web development skills step by step.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Cadence**: 5 days/week, ~2–3 hours/day (adjust as needed)  
- **Style**: Learn → build a tiny feature → ship a small artifact (repo, demo, screenshot)  
- **Rhythm (each week)**: Topics · Practice tasks · Mini-project · Deliverable  
- **Tracking**: All work organized in weekly folders (`week-01` … `week-16`)  
- **Scope**: 16-week “bootcamp” to competence, then months 5–12 for professional polish

## 📖 Phases & Weekly Details

### **Phase 1 — Modern Web Foundations (Weeks 1–3)**  
- **Week 1**: HTML & semantics, forms, images, tables → deliverable: `sitemap.html`

- **Week 3**: Modern JavaScript, DOM, events → deliverable: interactive explorer  

### **Phase 2 — Pro Dev Habits (Week 4)**  
- Git, GitHub workflow, VS Code, DevTools → deliverable: dev-ready repo  

### **Phase 3 — Front-End Engineering (Weeks 5–8)**  
- Data handling, components, accessibility, React, routing/forms → deliverables: React explorer + admin form  

### **Phase 4 — Back-End Basics (Weeks 9–12)**  
- Node.js & Express, DB integration, connecting frontend ↔ API, authentication/roles → deliverables: APIs + live full-stack app  

### **Phase 5 — Full-Stack Capstone (Weeks 13–16)**  
- Admin UX, API endpoints, CSV importer, hardening & deploy → deliverables: deployed full-stack product ingestion system
